---

## 🎯 Objective

- Write clean, modular React code
- Use Tailwind CSS for layout and styling
- Implement basic interactivity with React state

---

## 🧩 Requirements

1. **Header Section**
   - Left: Logo (text placeholder is fine)
   - Center: Navigation links – *Home*, *Features*, *Contact*
   - Right: A button labeled **“Get Started”**

2. **Hero Section**
   - Left side:
     - Heading: **“Build your dream website”**
     - Subtext: *“Learn how to create a website with the latest technology and trends.”*
     - Button: **“Learn More”**
   - Right side: Image placeholder (simple box or SVG illustration)

3. **Feature Cards**
   - 3 cards side-by-side (responsive: stack vertically on mobile)
   - Each card contains:
     - An icon (placeholder or emoji)
     - Title (e.g. “Easy to use”, “Fast performance”, “Good design”)
     - Description (2 lines of dummy text)

4. **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**
   - Add a small toggle button that switches between light and dark themes.
   - The entire page background and text colors should update accordingly.

5. **Responsiveness**
   - Layout should adjust gracefully between desktop, tablet, and mobile widths.

6. **Hover Effects**
   - Buttons and feature cards should show smooth hover transitions (e.g. slight scale-up or background color change).

## ⚙️ Technical Guidelines
- Use **React functional components** (hooks allowed).
- Use **Tailwind CSS** only for styling (no other CSS frameworks).
- You may use **Vite** or **Create React App** (your choice).
- Focus on clean, maintainable component structure.

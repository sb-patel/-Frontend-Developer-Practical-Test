# -Frontend-Developer-Practical-Test
Evaluate your ability to accurately convert a design into a functional, responsive React component using Tailwind CSS.

🧩 Requirements

Header Section

Left: Logo (text placeholder is fine)

Center: Navigation links – Home, Features, Contact

Right: A button labeled “Get Started”

Hero Section

Left side:

Heading: “Build your dream website”

Subtext: “Learn how to create a website with the latest technology and trends.”

Button: “Learn More”

Right side: Image placeholder (simple box or SVG illustration)

Feature Cards

3 cards side-by-side (responsive: stack vertically on mobile)

Each card contains:

An icon (placeholder or emoji)

Title (e.g. “Easy to use”, “Fast performance”, “Good design”)

Description (2 lines of dummy text)

Light/Dark Theme Toggle

Add a small toggle button that switches between light and dark themes.

The entire page background and text colors should update accordingly.

Responsiveness

Layout should adjust gracefully between desktop, tablet, and mobile widths.

Hover Effects

Buttons and feature cards should show smooth hover transitions (e.g. slight scale-up or background color change).

⚙️ Technical Guidelines

Use React functional components (hooks allowed).

Use Tailwind CSS only for styling (no other CSS frameworks).

You may use Vite or Create React App (your choice).

Focus on clean, maintainable component structure.

Add simple animation using Tailwind transitions.

Include semantic HTML tags for accessibility.
